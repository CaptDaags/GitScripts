This is a tutorial on how to get, update and push changes back to my Git repository

First mkdir a landing spot for the clone 
Then get the repo from Git with: git clone https://github.com/CaptDaags/hello-world.git
Make any mods and save

Then the process is to:
git add filename_of_modified_file             #This stages the changes for committing
git commit -m "Your message re what changed"  #This commits your staged changes locally. The
                                               -m stops the editor being popped to add one.
 
git push                                      #This will push the changes to the Git repository. You'll need the user/pwd

If you push without committing, nothing gets pushed. If you commit without adding, nothing gets committed.

If you add without committing, nothing at all happens, git merely remembers that the changes you added should
be considered for the following commit.

To update existing copy of repo to the local drive:
Using GIT BASH navigate to the directory containing the local copy and then execute:
git pull origin master

NB Working with GitHub you will probably have to do a git config user.email "myemail@server.com" to get the
commit to work.
